:new 			- Create blank buffer.
:set ft? 		- Check the filetype.
:set ft=python		- Set the filetype of the current buffer (useful with :new).


Assign a file name when creating the blank buffer:
:new mynewfile.py
:edit mynewfile.py
:tabnew mynewfile.py


:imap 			- To display the currently defined insert mode maps.
:ls			- To see a list of current buffers.
:e ../myfile.py		- To open a new file.



	* Normal Mode *
. 			- insert last line.
yy or Y			- copy line.
p or P			- paste line.
$			- last key
%                       - jumps between pairs of parenthesis ( )'s, { }'s, [ ]'s.
ZQ			- to exit unconditionally without changing anything (equal :q!)
ZZ		      	- saves the file and exits. Saves the current file if modified and exits or closes the current window/tab (same as :x but not :wq which writes the file even if it hasn't been modified). 
Q			- Quit (same as :q)
:x 			- is one key less than :wq
:xa			- To exit unconditionally after having written all the modified files in all windows, tabs and hidden buffers (it still won't exit if some files can't be written for a reason or another)
